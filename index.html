                    Hi, I'm Ravi Patel! I'm a passionate developer who loves to build cool 
                    projects (even if its just for fun). I'm a pretty simple person and like 
                    to keep things light hearted, so I'll just list off a few skills and 
                    facts about me here.

                        Not so long ago I started learning more about cybersecurity. I learn
                        by building projects, so I read some documentation and jumped straight
                        in. SHA is a repository that has the SHA-1 and SHA-256 cryptographic 
                        hashing functions, built using Javascript. Here's a quick

                    To get to know me a little more as a developer, I've listed off a 
                    few things here about what tools I use and what I'm working on.
                    I'll also edit this list as I make progress, so be sure to check back 
                    for updates if you're interested.
